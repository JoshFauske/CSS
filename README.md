<h1>Intro to CSS</h1>

<p>This is an introduction to CSS. Included is a starter folder with 2 starter files that are blank templtes in which you can work on. Also included is a Master folder with 2 master files that are completed with CSS rules.</p>

<p>I recommend downloading the starter files and following along with my CSS Tutorial on YouTube</p>
